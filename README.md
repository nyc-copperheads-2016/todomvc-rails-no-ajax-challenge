# TODO MVC on Rails Challenge
## Learning Competencies
- Understand the red-green-refactor development cycle
- TDD/BDD your way through a simple app
- Comfortable with not writing a signle line of code without writing the test first
## Objective:
TDD your way to building a Todo app with Rails. This will happen through a series of steps. This Readme will change with each step explaining the objective of the step, what's been implemented and what you'll be implementing.

Each step will build the previous step's "what you'll be implementing" section. This will allow you to compare your solution with mine.

## Your approach:
- Read the Readme.
- Review your solution of your previous step against our solution.
- Follow the instructions on how to run the "what's been implemented" section. Inspect, study and ask lots of questions about what's been implemented.
- Move to "what you'll be implementing":
  - Start with a plan: write your own Readme that outlines what you're about todo and the steps you'll take to meet your objectives. Please don't skip this, the format is irrelevant, choose something that makes sense to you and stick to it.
  - Implement your solutions as outlined in your Readme.
  - 1000.times { puts "please don't copy and paste"}, the purpose of this challenge is for you to get inspired by an example and go and implement your own. Make mistakes, get confused and most importantly ask lots of questions. Keep the "What's been implemented" section as a reference.
  - FYI: all of my work/solutions have been BDDed, not a single line of code in this project was written without a test first. The approach I outlined above, is the one I usually follow in my work as an engineer.

## Before you start:
  - What's behavior driven development?
  - Understand the Red, Green, Refactor cycle
  - We test outside in.
